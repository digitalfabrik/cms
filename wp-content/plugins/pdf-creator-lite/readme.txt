Let visitors and admins create PDFs of your site content at the click of a button.

== Description ==

PDF Creator Lite makes on-the-fly PDF documents of selected parts of your site. It has 2 main uses:

**Use it on pages and posts so your readers can download PDFs:**

*Basic Use:*
Just put the `[pdf-lite]` shortcode into your page or post and visitors can simply click a button to get a PDF document of that page.

*More Control:*
Use the shortcode parameters to choose specific pages, categories, or the entire site. Here's a few examples:

Makes a PDF of all posts:
`[pdf-lite allposts="true"]`

Makes a PDF of all pages:
`[pdf-lite allpages="true"]`

Makes a PDF of selected pages/posts (use post ids or slugs):
`[pdf-lite page="3, 28, my-post-slug"]`

Makes a PDF of posts in the categories 'music' and 'food':
`[pdf-lite cat="music, food"]`

Changes the download icon:
`[pdf-lite icon="3"]`

See the full list of parameters on the settings page ( Dashboard->Tools->PDF Creator ).
 
<br>
**Use it as an admin tool to create customised PDFs of selected or all site pages (not posts):**

- Customise the colours and fonts
- Simple and easy to use

Go to the settings page ( Dashboard->Tools->PDF Creator ) to make your PDF.
