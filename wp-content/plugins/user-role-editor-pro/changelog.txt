* Core version: 4.54
* Fix: Front-end menu access add-on: 
* - Do not switch menu walker to custom one starting from WordPress version 5.4 as it natively supports 'wp_nav_menu_item_custom_fields' action.

    - when you leave 'Redirect to:' parameter empty user is redirected to the login page and back to the initial URL after the successful login.
* Update: Gravity Forms access add-on:
*   - Function GFFormsModel::get_lead_table_name() call was replaced with GFFormsModel::get_entry_table_name() to provide compatibility with Gravity Forms v. 2.3+.
*   - Gravity forms entry_detail page was added to the list of pages for which URE should control the list of available Gravity Forms.
* Fix: Posts/Pages edit restrictions add-on: 
*   - infinite recursion was possible in some cases for 'pre_get_posts' action in posts-edit-access.php;
*   - "Fatal error: Call to undefined method URE_Content_View_Restrictions::is_page_template_resticted_for_role() in content-view-restrictions.php on line 581" was fixed.
* Core version was updated to 4.41:
* New: URE changes currently selected role via AJAX request, without full "Users->User Role Editor" page refresh.
* Update: All [WPBakery Visual Composer](http://vc.wpbakery.com) plugin custom user capabilities (started from 'vc_access_rules_') were excluded from processing by User Role Editor. Visual Composer loses settings made via its own "Role Manager" after the role update by User Role Editor in other case. The reason - Visual Composer stores not boolean values with user capabilities granted to the roles via own "Role Manager". User Role Editor converted them to related boolean values during role(s) update.

= [4.44] 06.04.2018 =
* Core version: 4.40.3
* Update: Integration with bbPress was enhanced.
* Core version was updated to 4.40.3:
* Update: bbPress detection and code for integration with it was updated to support multisite installations when URE is network activated but bbPress is activated on some sites of the network only. (Free version does not support bbPress roles. It excludes them from processing as bbPress creates them dynamically.)

= [4.43] 04.04.2018 =
* Core version: 4.40.1
* Fix: Core version was reversed back to 4.40.1 due to fatal error cause by 4.40.2 update for some installations with active bbPress.

= [4.42] 04.04.2018 =
* Core version: 4.40.2
* New: Content View Restrictions add-on: 
* - New criteria "Page Templates" were added to content view restrictions for roles.

* Update: Admin menu access add-on: full admin menu copy creation code priority at 'admin_menu' hook was increased from 1000 to 9999. It should be executed after other plugins. MetaSlider plugin adds its admin menu with 9553 priority.
* Fix: Content View Restrictions add-on: 
  - "Redirect to URL" option did not work for pages.
  - pages linked to BuddyPress components activity, groups, members ignored restrictions set by URE.
* Fix: Meta Boxes Access add-on: meta boxes blocking code hooked to the general 'add_meta_boxes' action had fired too early and could not block meta boxes added via 'add_meta_boxes_{post_type}' hook executed later.
*
* Core version was updated to 4.40.2:
* Update: Load required .php files from the active bbPress plugin directly, as in some cases URE code may be executed earlier than they are loaded by bbPress.

= [4.41] 06.02.2018 =
* Core version: 4.40.1
* New: Export-import module was rewritten:
* - Attention: New exported data format is not compatible with data exported by older versions.

* New: Content View Restrictions add-on: redirect to URL option was added for access error action.
* Update: URE_Admin_Menu::load_menu_access_data_for_role() method was renamed to URE_Admin_Menu::load_data_for_role().
* Update: URE_Admin_Menu::load_menu_access_data_for_user() method was renamed to URE_Admin_Menu::load_data_for_user().
* Update: Page permissions viewer add-on: source code tracing was returned back (if available).
* Update: Other roles access add-on: changes were applied for compatibility with PHP versions prior 5.5
* Fix: Content View Restrictions add-on: 
* - HTML layout issue was fixed at the "Action" section of post editor meta box.
* - Restrictions were not applied properly for WooCommerce products list via [products] shortcode as WooCommerce may cache query result of unrestricted user for 30 days and show that cached data to users with restricted view access.
* Fix: Admin menu access add-on (URE_Admin_Menu_Access::update_menu()): bug in menu update may lead to the indefinite redirection loop as a blocked URL was selected as the 1st available menu item link.
*
* Core version was updated to 4.40.1:
* Update: use wp_roles() function from WordPress API instead of initializing $wp_roles global directly. wp_roles() function (introduced with WP 4.3) was included conditionally to URE code for backward compatibility with WordPress 4.0+
* Fix: Bug was introduced by version 4.37 with users recalculation for "All" tab after excluding users with "administrator" role. Code worked incorrectly for Japanese locale.
* Fix: WordPress multisite: bbPress plugin detection code was changed from checking bbPress API function existence to checking WordPress active plugins list. bbPress plugin activated for the site was not available yet for the network activated User Role Editor at the point of URE instance creation. URE did not work with bbPress roles as it should by design.

= [4.40.1] 22.12.2017 =
* Core version: 4.39
* Fix: Content View Restrictions add-on: change of "For Users" field in post/page editor "Content View Restrictions" meta box was not saved properly after the 4.40 update.

= [4.40] 20.12.2017 =

* Update: Admin menu access add-on: 'paged' argument was added as allowed by default for upload.php URL.
* Fix: Admin menu access add-on: White-listed URL arguments were not taken into account in case URL started not with 'admin.php' and contained a 'page' argument.

= [4.39] 27.11.2017 =
* Core version: 4.38
* New: Admin menu access add-on: It's possible to manage the allowed URL parameters list via "White list of URLs parameters' link. This link is located at "Settings->User Role Editor->Additional Module" tab, just under "Activate Administrator Menu Access module" checkbox.

* Fix: Posts/pages edit restrictions add-on: excluded the cases, when edit restrictions would be applied to a user with superadmin priveleges.
* Core version was updated to 4.38
* Security: XSS vulnerability was fixed at URE's options page. Bug was discovered and fixed at tab index value numeric type checking. Tab index value is additionally escaped before output also.
* Security: Deprecated code for debug output to the .log file in case of database query error was removed.
* Security: Multiple select jQuery plugin (https://github.com/wenzhixin/multiple-select/) was updated to the latest available version 1.2.1, which fixed XSS vulnerability, existed in earlier versions.

= [4.38] 04.11.2017 =
* Core version: 4.37
* New: User permissions viewer add-on was added. It shows at the bottom of every admin backend (wp-admin) page the user capabilities list checked by this page and plugins hooked to it.
* New: bbPress user capabilities are shown at User Role Editor under the separate group "Custom capabilities->bbPress" if bbPress plugin is active.
* Update: Content edit restrictions add-on: removed unneeded current user admin permissions checking, which was executed for every WordPress page.
* Update: Admin menu access add-on: redirection code for blocked URL was enhanced.
* Update: Content view restrictions add-on: hooks to WordPress with 999 priority instead of former 100 for better compatibility with other plugins.
* Fix: Content view restrictions add-on: WP_Query query variable 'post__not_in' is set in case when 'post__in' is not set. Otherwise prohibited posts are excluded from existing 'post__in' array.
* Fix: Other roles access add-on: Users with roles blocked for current user are excluded from the users list. Quantity of users of 'All' view (tab) at 'Users' page is decreased now for the quantity of hidden users.
*
* Core version was updated to 4.37
* New: New option was added to the "Settings->User Role Editor->General" tab. It's possible to set a default value for a quant of columns at capabilities section of the main User Role Editor page.
* Update: User capabilities are shown for custom post types which use the WordPress built-in 'post' or 'page' capability type. (0/0) was shown earlier instead of the quantity of user capabilities really used.
* Update: Restriction was added for 'do_not_allow' user capability (used internally by WordPress). You can not add it manually.
* Fix: URE hides users with 'administrator' role by default from any other user. Quantity of users of 'All' view (tab) at 'Users' page is decreased now for the quantity of hidden administrators.

= [4.37] 27.09.2017 =
* Core version: 4.36.1
* New: Required WordPress version was raised up to 4.4. Front-end menu access add-on does not support earlier WordPress versions.
* New: Posts/pages edit restrictions add-on: User with restrictions by categories can use 'Clone' link from 'Duplicate Post' plugin. The 1st category available to a current user will be assigned automatically to a new created post copy in order to make this post editable to this user.
* Fix: Posts/pages edit restrictions add-on: URE will extend automatically the list of allowed/restricted attachments for media library items, attached to allowed/restricted posts/pages/CPT.
* Update: Content View Restrictions shortcode add-on: Shortcode [user_role_editor] was not processed/rendered by default for a user with 'administrator' role, 
  following a logic "there are not restrictions for administrators". It's changed according to multiple user requests. Users with 'administrator' role will not see not rendered [user_role_editor]...[/user_role_editor] shortcode text at front-end starting with this update. It does not depend from a 'ure_render_content_view_shortcode_for_admin' filter value. All [user_role_editor] shortcodes are rendered for all users, including superadmin. 
  It's possible to change this default behavior via custom filter 'ure_render_content_view_shortcode_for_admin'. It takes a single boolean parameter. Change it to FALSE in order a user with 'administrator' role can see a raw content instead of a rendered/restricted one.  
* Fix:Front end menu access add-on: 
*   - Access filter is applied for front-end only to get rid off accidental deletion of restricted menu items.
*   - 'wp_get_nav_menu_items' filter is used now instead of 'wp_nav_menu_objects' one, which fires too late for case when some plugin uses own code to show WordPress navigation menu and do not uses wp_nav_menu() function from WordPress core.
*   - URE does not override WordPress front-end menu output method as earlier, it uses reqexp to insert custom action to the right place of WordPress front-end menu output.
* Fix: Admin menu access add-on: 
*      - User with 'manage_categories' capability, but without 'edit_posts' one, did not have access to the Posts->Categories, Posts->Tags menu items with active "Admin menu access" add-on.
*      - 'Block not selected' model did not allow search and sort operations with categories and tags. User was redirected to the dashboard automatically.
* Fix: Incompatibility issue with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin was fixed - meta boxes added by ACF were not recognized by "Widgets access" add-on.
* Update: Direct access to the global $current_user variable is excluded from the code. Current user data is initialized via WordPress core functions wp_get_current_user() or get_current_user_id().
* Update: Various unused pieces of code were removed.
*
* Core version was updated to 4.36.1
* Update: Direct access to the global $current_user variable is excluded from the code. Current user data is initialized via WordPress core functions wp_get_current_user() or get_current_user_id().
* New: It's possible to set any URE's option value programmatically: use custom filter 'ure_get_option_<option_name>'. It takes a single parameter with current/default value for required options.
  Full list of User Role Editor options is available here: https://www.role-editor.com/documentation/options-list
* Update: Users page - Grant Roles. It's possible to change just "Other roles" for multiple users and leave their primary roles untouched. Just leave a "Primary role" field empty. If you select the "- No role for this site -" option from a "Primary role" drop-down list, plugin will revoke all roles from the selected users.
* Update: Options page screen help text was updated.
* Fix: Additional (other) default roles set at URE's settings page are not granted to a new user now, if they were deselected at a 'Add New User' page.

* Core version: 4.35.2
* New: Content view restrictions shortcode: 'users', 'except_users' attributes were added to the existing 'user_role_editor' shortcode. It's possible to use digital user IDs or symbolic user logins, e.g. users="11, 25, billy" or except_users="18, peggy".
* Fix: Admin menu access add-on: submenu which is not linked to the main menu are removed now from internal URE Pro data structures to exclude PHP notices, like Undefined offset: 3 in wp-content/plugins/user-role-editor-pro/pro/includes/classes/admin-menu-access.php on line 214
* Update: JavaScript code enhancements.
* Core version was updated to 4.35.2:
* Fix: Multiple default roles (if defined at URE's settings) are selected automatically at 'add-new-user' page.

= [4.35.2] 10.07.2017 =
* Core version: 4.35.1
* Fix: Gravity Forms access add-on: view of entries from prohibited forms via direct URL was not blocked. 
* Fix: Admin menu access add-on: It was not possible to block menu items when user had access to some submenu item, like "Categories", but did not have access to a top level menu, like 'Posts'. 'Categories' was shown in spite of it was configured as blocked.

* Fix: The same ID "move_from_no_role" and "move_from_no_role_dialog" were output twice at "Users" page.

= [4.35.1] 11.06.2017 =

* Core was updated to version 4.35
* Update: Bulk capabilities selection checkbox is not shown for 'administrator' role for single site WP, and is shown if current user is superadmin for multisite WP. It was done to exclude sudden revoke of all capabilities from the 'administrator' role.
* Update: Full copy of JQuery UI 1.11.4 custom theme CSS file (jquery-ui.css) was included.
* Fix: User->User Role Editor page apparently loads own jQuery UI CSS (instead of use of WordPress default one) in order to exclude the conflicts with themes and plugins which can load own jQuery UI CSS globally not for own pages only.
* Fix: "Change Log" link was replaced with secure https://www.role-editor.com/changelog


= [4.35] 04.06.2017 =

* Core version: 4.33.1
* Fix: Content view restrictions add-on: PHP notice was removed: Undefined variable: self in /wp-content/plugins/user-role-editor-pro/pro/includes/classes/content-view-restrictions.php on line 795


= [4.34.2] 22.05.2017 =
* Core version: 4.33.1
* New: Posts/pages edit restrictions add-on: custom filter 'ure_edit_posts_access_restriction_type' was added. It allows to modify on a fly the restriction type for current user: 1 - prohibit, 2 - allow.
* Update: "Use jQuery UI CSS from jQuery CDN" option was removed from the "General" tab of User Role Editor Pro Settings page. URE uses CSS styles included into own installation package.
* Fix: Content view restrictions add-on: 
* - URE_Content_View_Restrictions::current_user_can_view() returned incorrect result for some restrictions settings.
* - URE_Content_View_Restrictions_Posts_List::do_not_restrict_editors() could intercept with Posts/pages edit restrictions add-on by recursive call of view filter when WP_Query selects posts available for editing.
* - ure_restrict_content_view_for_authors_and_editors filter was ignored for single page content.
* Update: Core version was updated to 4.33.1:

* New: Core version: boolean filter 'ure_bulk_grant_roles' allows to not show "Users->Grant Roles" button if you don't need it.
* New: Core version: boolean filter 'ure_users_select_primary_role' can hide 'Primary role' selection controls from the user profile edit page. 
* New:  Core version: boolean filter 'ure_users_show_wp_change_role' can hide "Change Role" bulk action selection control from the Users page. So it's possible to configure permissions for user who can change just other roles of a user without changing his primary role.
* Fix: "Users->Without Roles", "Users->Grant Roles" are shown only to the users with 'edit_users' capability.
* Fix: Transients caching was removed from URE_Lib::_get_post_types() function. It cached post types list too early in some cases.


= [4.34.1] 24.04.2017 =
* Core version: 4.32.3
* Fix: Front end menu access add-on: a lot of pages became restricted for front-end menu due to logic mistake in an access checking code. As a result related menu items were hidden from menu without a visible reason.

= [4.34] 21.04.2017 =
* Core version: 4.32.3
* New: Front end menu access add-on: 
*   - "Not logged-in and logged-in users with selected roles" option was added.
*   - menu items with links to the posts/pages prohibited for view for current user by "Content view restrictions" add-on with 404 HTTP error action are excluded from menu automatically.
* New: Content view restrictions add-on: 
*   - Shortcode [user_role_editor] roles / except_roles attributes support '&&' role ID separator. For example roles="subscriber && customer" means that user should have both roles simultaneously, comparing to the roles="subscriber, customer" which works for subscribers or customers or (subscribers and customers).
*   - public static method URE_Content_View_Restrictions::current_user_can_view($post_id) was added. It returns boolean value.
* Update: Content view restrictions add-on:
*   - roles list opened at the post level is sorted by alphabet.
*   - Singleton pattern was applied to the URE_Content_View_Restrictions_Posts_List class.
* Update: Admin menu access add-on: "block not selected model": support was added for URL parameters added to users.php by "Ultimate Member" plugin.
* Fix: Content view restrictions add-on:

*   - categories/tags/terms group selection checkboxes work separately now for every term group - categories, tags, etc.
* Fix: bbPress role support was broken, even administrator did not see bbPress menu and user roles in some cases while User Role Editor Pro was active.
* Fix: Admin menu access add-on: "block not selected model" did not allow to delete users and use other core WordPress functionality at "users.php' page redirecting user to the 1st available admin menu item.

* Core version: 4.32.3
* New: Content view restrictions add-on: authors list and own data only options were added for roles.

*   - filter by categories may work incorrectly due to mistake in the SQL query;
*   - content-view-restrictions-controller.php used not existed function URE_Lib_Pro::filter_int_array().

* Fix: Admin menu access add-on: "Block not selected" model: 
*   - search a user at "Users" page was finished by the automatic redirection to the 1st available menu item (Dashboard, etc.). The list of allowed parameters for 'Users' page was extended for the search and sort parameters used at this page by WordPress core.
*   - selection of 'Media Library->Add new' menu item was resulted by removing of 'Upload Files' tab at a dialog opened by "Add Media" button from the post/page editor screen.
* Fix: Bulk grant to users multiple roles JavaScript code is loaded now for users.php page only, not globally.
* Fix: nonexistent html_esc__() function was called instead of valid esc_html__() one at pro/includes/classes/posts-edit-access-bulk-action.php file.
* Fix: "Users->Grant Roles" button did not work with switched off option "Count Users without role" at "Settings->User Role Editor->Additional Modules" tab. "JQuery UI" library was not loaded.
* Fix: Boolean false was sent to WordPress core wp_enqueue_script() function as the 2nd parameter instead of an empty string. We should respect the type of parameter which code author supposed to use initially.
* Update: minimal PHP version was raised to 5.3.

= [4.32.3] 10.03.2017 =
* Core version: 4.32.1
* New: Button "Grant Roles" allows to "Assign multiple roles to the selected users" directly from the "Users" page.
* Update: singleton template was applied to the main class User Role Editor Pro. While GLOBALS['user-role-editor'] reference to the instance of User_Role_Editor_Pro class is still available for the compatibility reasons, call to User_Role_Editor_Pro::get_instance() is the best way now to get a reference to the instance of User_Role_Editor_Pro class.
* Fix: Content view restrictions add-on: PHP notice "Undefined index: ure_post_access_error_action in content-view-restrictions-controller.php" was removed.
* Fix: 'unfiltered_html' capability was added to the 'General' capabilities group.

= [4.32.2] 10.02.2017 =

* Update: Posts edit access add-on: It's possible to modify posts/pages, custom post type ID list via filter 'ure_edit_posts_access_id_list'. ID list is a comma separated list of integers.

* Core version: 4.31
* Fix: Admin menu access add-on: Blocked menu without submenu was not hidden.
* Fix: Gravity form access add-on: invalid redirection took place for many 'admin.php?page=some-page' URLs.
* New: Admin menu access add-on: 'ure_admin_menu_access_admin_bar' filter allows to extend the list of top admin menu bar items which could be hidden if their main admin menu was blocked.

= [4.31] 15.12.2016 =
* Core version: 4.31
* New: It's possible to remove unused user capabilities by list.
* Fix: There was no support for installations with a hidden/changed URL to wp-admin. URE uses 'admin_url()' now to get and check admin URL, instead of direct comparing URL with 'wp-admin' string.
* Fix: Admin menu access add-on: custom links under Settings menu were converted from /wp-admin/options-general.php?page=some-key to /wp-admin/some-key incorrectly in some cases.
* Fix: Front-end menu access add-on: access controls were shown at menu editing form for user without 'ure_front_end_menu_access' capability.
* Update: Admin menu access add-on: Contact Form 7 plugin URL parameters are supported to exclude redirection to dasboard.
* Update: Capability groups CSS classes are prefixed with 'ure-' in order to minimize possible CSS conflicts with other plugins/themes which may load styles with the same classes.

* New: "Granted Only" checkbox to the right from "Quick Filter" input control allows to show only granted capabilities for the selected role.
* New: Front-end menu access add-on is available. It's possible to show menu items for everyone, logged-in users, logged-in users with selected role(s), not-logged-in visitors (<a href="https://www.role-editor.com/documentation/front-end-menu-access/">more info...</a>).
* Update: Admin menu access add-on: Top level menu items list is ordered similar way as WordPress itself use.
* Fix: Content view restrictions add-on: Content of a post prohibited for logged-in user with the selected role only was not shown for the not logged-in users. But it should be shown until this post is not prohibited apparently for the 'no_role' (No role for this site) virtual role too.
* Fix: Admin menu access add-on: There was automatic redirect to admin dashboard after WooCommerce->Coupons->Add New (or similar) button click under "Block menu items: Not Selected" model, in case "Posts->Add New" was not allowed.

= [4.29.1] 11.11.2016 =
* Core version: 4.29
* New: User Role Editor own user capabilities are grouped separately under Custom capabilities.
* Fix: Content View Restrictions add-on: Custom error message from the post editor was not shown in some cases, system global default message was shown instead.
* Fix: Content Edit Restrictions add-on: restricted user saw at post Visual editor a gallery with full list of available images instead of the allowed images included into this gallery only.
* Update: Content Edit Restrictions add-on: user with 'create_%' capability (like 'create_posts') can add new items (posts) inspite of editing restrictions applied to him. One of the purposes of this update was to allow to a user create the child pages under the allowed parent page.
* Update: Automatic updates server URL was changed to https://update.role-editor.com
* Update: URE_Lib::is_super_admin() uses WordPress core is_super_admin() for multisite setup only. Superadmin is a user with 'administrator' role in the case of single site WordPress installation.
*   This is the difference with the WordPress core which counts as a superadmin (for single site WP installation) any user with a 'delete_users' capability.
*   So it's possible to apply add-on restrictions (e.g. admin menu access) to the users without administrator role, but with 'delete_users' capability.
* Update: BaseLib::option_selected() calls were replaced with the calls of a similar selected() function from WordPress core.

= [4.29] 25.10.2016 =
* Core version: 4.28
* New: Meta Boxes access add-on: 'Remove' icon at admin page of this add-on allows to exclude from the list meta boxes which belong to the deleted plugins.
* Fix: Posts edit access restrictions add-on: 
        - sometimes restrictions were applied before a restricted custom post type was defined.<br>
        - post quant by the post status were calculated incorrectly for the "Prohibit" option.
* Fix: Admin menu access add-on:<br>
    - The endless redirection loop could took place if the "Dashboard" menu was blocked ( URE_Admin_Menu_Access::update_menu_selected() ).<br>
    - URL for redirection to one of Jetpack submenu items was built incorrectly.
* Update: Admin menu access add-on: 
    - URL parameters 'action', 'menu' were registered as allowed for the 'nav-menus.php' ('Appearance->Menus') command to exclude unexpected redirections.<br>
    - WooCommerce products, orders, coupons filtering arguments in URLs are supported now.
      If you prohibited for the role 'Posts' menu, but allow WooCommerce 'Products', 'Orders' or 'Coupons' (use the same edit.php in URL), 
      you could meet a problem with filtering  WooCommerce product by category or product type, etc. User would be redirected to the dashboard - 
      This means that URLs with filtering parameters in it (like product_cat, product_type) was blocked by URE.<br>
    - Block not selected model: URE does not block by default these admin menu bar items: Profile, Log Out. Menu items was checked by URL. 
      Menu item ID is checked now instead, as URL may be changed by plugins, like one which changes 'wp-admin' to the custom string. 
      It's possible to modify the list of not blocked menu bar items ID using custom filter 'ure_do_not_remove_from_admin_bar'.
* Update: Posts view restrictions add-on: input form and list of default values were enhanced/extended.
* Update: Meta boxes access add-on takes into account the meta boxes placed by BuddyPress plugin to the user profile "Extended Profile" tab.
* New: WooCommerce plugin user capabilities (if exist) are grouped separately.
* Update: Temporally raised permissions flag is taken into account when checking, if user has a superadmin privileges. WordPress is_super_admin() function was replaced with custom wrapper to define if current user is a real superadmin or just a local admin with the temporally raised (add/edit users pages) permissions.
* Update: various code optimization.

    - URE takes into account that "WCMp Commissions" menu from "WC Marketplace" plugin may be added as to "WooCommerce" menu, as a top level menu item;<br>

    - support was added for additional URL parameters from plugins: Ninja Forms, EventON.
* Update: Posts edit restrictions add-on: URE does no replace posts statuses views (All, Mine, Published etc.) for the restricted user. It just refreshes the quant of posts for every existed status view.

* Update: URE_Ajax_Processor class allows to diffirentiate required user permissions according to action submitted by user.
* Update: Admin menu access module: 
    - Filter 'ure_admin_menu_access_allowed_args' was added. Use it to register URL parameters in order URE does not block the links inside allowed pages.It happens generally when you use 'block not selected' model.

    - "Block not Selected" model blocked allowed URLs inside Media Library (started from upload.php) and Appearance Menus (started from nav-menus.php) and other allowed URLs (just with additional parameters).
    - WordPress Multisite - single site administrator get "Admin menu" dialog in the read-only mode for all roles. He should not edit just its own 'administrator' role.
    - Direct access to the blocked menu item via URL was possible for URLs like one from WooCommerce's "Products->Attributes" menu item: 
           wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=product&page=product_attributes.
    - Blocked menu item could be selected as the 1st available menu item which leaded to the endless redirect loop.

  It seems that it's too late to insert it into the theme's functions.php file.
* Update: Content view restrictions are applied now to the front-end only. Use edit restrictions add-on to manage posts/pages visibility at WordPress back-end.
* Update: data update notice is shown now for all add-ons.

* New: "Meta Boxes Access" add-on allows to manage access for roles to meta boxes of editor (posts, pages, custom post types) and dashboard pages (<a href="https://www.role-editor.com/documentation/block-meta-boxes-for-role/">more details...</a>).
* New: License key is checked in the real time after its input to help exclude input errors.

User Role Editor Options page help section was updated.
Fix: Admin menu access restrictions were not applied at 'new-user.php' page under multisite for the single site administrator role with 'allow_edit_users_to_not_super_admin' option turned on. Special flag was set to indicate that single site admin gets raised (superadmin) permissions temporary for the 'user-new.php' page, but current user is not the superadmin really. (This temporary permissions raising is done to allow single site admin to add new users under multisite.)
Fix: Custom posts types selection query was updated to include all custom post types except 'built-in' types when adding custom capabilities for them.
Fix: Admin menu access: URLs beyound admin menu are not blocked for the "block not selected" model now. This allows to work with posts under this model of blocking for example.

Fix: Default role value has not been refreshed automatically after change at the "Default Role" dialog.
Fix: global $post variable was changed in some cases by the "Posts view restrictions" add-on.
Fix: Admin menu access add-on: User could upload new media at the Post Editor with "Media -> Add New" menu item blocked. "File Upload" tab is removed in this case now. User may select from the existing Media Library items only.
More detailed notice messages are shown after default role change - to reflect a possible error or problem.
Other default roles (in addition to the primary role) was assigned to a new registered user for requests from the admin back-end only. Now this feature works for the requests from the front-end user registration forms too (including WordPress multisite).
Interface to Posts bulk action "Edit access" was available to the users without "ure_edit_posts_access" capability - fixed. Action itself was not fulfilled (blocked at server side) due to obvious permissions error.
Content view restrictions add-on: custom post types selection enhanced in order to include types which are not public 
Content view restrictions add-on: processes now custom post type content beyond the main loops, including 'wlbdash'(Dashboard) post type from "White Label Branding for WordPress Multisite" plugin.
Content edit restrictions add-on: supports unique create custom post type capability even in case it does not use 'edit_' in its name. For example for 'wlbdash' post type, create post capability will get name 'create_wlbdashs' instead of default 'wlb_dashboard_tool'.
Admin menu access add-on: bug was fixed for URL starting from 'admin.php?page='
Added new filter 'ure_get_allowed_gf_forms'. It allows to modify array of Gravity Forms ID available to the current user.
CSS enhanced to exclude column wrapping for the capabilities with the long names.
The translation text domain was changed to the plugin slug (user-role-editor) for the compatibility with translations.wordpress.org

* Other roles access add-on: 
*   1) 'block not selected' access model was added to the default 'block selected' one. It is more convenient in cases when you wish to block automatically all new added roles.

*   6) Enhanced compatibility with the Events Manager plugin ( https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-manager ).
*   7) Fixed bug which did not allow to open roles list for a new (not saved) post.
*   8) It is possible to retrieve post view access restrictions data for the post ID from other plugins, 
    for example do not sent new post notification to the users, who don't have access to view it.

*   3) It is possible now to set edit restrictions for the user by category/taxonomy ID.
*   4) Pages filtering enhanced for compatibility with other plugins, respecting "get_pages" filter (like "CMS Tree Page View" one).

*   6) If posts/pages restrictions were not set for the user, full list of media library items is available.
*   7) Filter ure_attachments_show_full_list allows to show full Media Library items list to the user with editing restrictions set.
*   8) Filter ure_posts_show_full_list allows to show full posts/pages/custom posts types list to the user with editing restrictions set.

= [4.18.5] 14.06.2015 =
* It is possible to input license code to the wp-config.php now. Add this line: 
define(URE_LICENSE_KEY, 'your-license-code-here');

* License code saved at the "Settings->User Role Editor->General" tab is not removed anymore after change of site absolute path, host or database name.
* Bug was fixed: "Network Update" did not work at FireFox due to JavaScript bug.
* PHP notice was removed. It was shown at the Plugins page, when an update to the URE Pro was available.

= [4.18.4] 28.05.2015 =
* Bug fix: Edit posts/pages restrictions add-on: Now user can not edit prohibited post/page manually inserting its ID to the edit URL.
* Admin menu access add-on: 'Customize' menu item is available now for non-English WordPress default languages too.

= [4.18.3] 06.05.2015 =
* Bug fix for "Admin menu access" add-on: direct access to the wp-admin/customize.php link (Appearance->Customize menu item) was not blocked properly. 
* As additional security measure "Welcome" panel is removed for the role with access restriction to the "Customize" admin menu item.

= [4.18.2] 30.04.2015 =
* Calls to the functions add_query_arg(), remove_query_arg() are escaped with esc_url_raw() to exclude potential XSS vulnerabilities.

= [4.18.1] 24.02.2015 =
* Fixed PHP fatal error for "Reset" roles operation.
* Fixed current user capability checking before URE Options page open.
* 3 missed phrases were added to the translations files.

= [4.18] 11.02.2014 =
* Own custom user capabilities, e.g. 'ure_edit_roles' are used to restrict access to User Role Editor functionality. <a href="https://www.role-editor.com/user-role-editor-4-18-new-permissions/">More information...</a>

* Posts/pages edit access restriction add-on works with custom post types now.
* Posts/pages view access restriction works with custom post types now.
* Admin menu items with empty user capability are available in "Admin menu access" add-on now. "Participants Database" plugin defines its menu this way.
* Some plugins use meta capabilities instead of real user capabilities, like 'jetpack_admin_page' in "JetPack" or 'wpcf7_read_contact_forms' in "Contact Form 7". "Admin menu access" add-on recognizes such meta capabilities now. These meta-caps are replaced at "Admin menu" window with correspondent (mapped) real user capabilities for your further reference.
* Admin menu access add-on updated: 'Howdy, ...' menu including 'Logout' menu item at top bar admin menu will not disappear after blocking 'Profile' menu. 
* Top bar menu 'SEO' from "WP SEO from Yoast" plugin is blocked if user has no 'manage_options' capability or correspondent admin menu is blocked.

* More universal checking applied to the custom post type capabilities creation to exclude not existing property notices.
* New option "Edit user capabilities" was added. If it is unchecked - capabilities section of selected user will be shown in the readonly mode. Administrator (except superadmin for multisite) can not assign capabilities to the user directly. He should make it using roles only.
* Fixed JavaScript bug with 'Reset Roles' for FireFox v.34.

= [4.17] =
* "Other roles access" additional module was added. It allows to define which other roles user with current role may see at WordPress: dropdown menus, e.g assign role to user editing user profile, etc.
* Correspondent front-end admin menu bar items are blocked according to settings of "Admin menu blocking" add-on.
* Edit access restrictions add-on: Bulk actions helper was added. It is possible to select posts from the posts list and allow/prohibit access for editing them to the group of users. Go to the "Posts/Pages", select bulk action "Edit Access" and click "Apply".
* uninstall.php was updated to delete data of "Widgets access", "Other roles access" add-ons.
* Multisite: - case when URE was not network activated: It is possible to use own settings for single site activated instances of User Role Editor. It used the only version of settings values from the main blog earlier. 
  Important - in order to have ability to setup updates automatically URE should be activated for the main blog of the network.
  Some critical options were hidden from the "Multisite" tab for single site administrators. Single site admin should not have access to the options which purpose is to restrict him.
  Attention! In case you decide to allow single site administrator activate/deactivate User Role Editor himself, setup this PHP constant at the wp-config.php file:
  define('URE_ENABLE_SIMPLE_ADMIN_FOR_MULTISITE', 1);
  Otherwise single site admin will not see User Role Editor in the plugins list after its activation. User Role Editor hides itself under multisite from all users except superadmin by default.

= [4.16] 12.09.2014 =
* Rename role button was added to the URE toolbar. It allows to change user role display name (role ID is always the same). Be careful and double think before rename some built-in WordPress role.
* "create_sites" user capability was added to the list of built-in WordPress user capabilities for WordPress multisite. It does not exist by default. But it is used to control "Add New" button at the "Sites" page under WordPress multisite network admin.
* bug fix: WordPress database prefix value was not used in 2 SQL queries related to the "count users without role" module - updated.
* Admin menu access module: front-end admin menu bar was hidden for user for which you blocked at least one admin menu items.
* Admin menu access module: fixes for the processing of "Appearance" menu and its items "Themes", "Customize" (required user capability, etc.).
* Roles export: file name with exported roles data is built now using this scheme: ure-roles-backup_Y-m-d_h_i_s.dat, e.g. ure-roles-backup_2014-09-05_15_23_09.dat

= [4.15] 30.08.2014 =
* Widgets permissions module was added. If role has access to the "Widgets" menu item of "Appearance" menu, you may block access to the selected widgets for that role. Use a new "Widgets" button at the role editor page.

= [4.14.4] 04.08.2014 =
* Fix for: PHP Notice:  <code>Undefined variable: user_role_editor in user-role-editor-pro.php on line 69</code> introduced in version 4.14.2. If automatic updates feature was broken for you for that reason, update to this version manually.
* Integration with Gravity Forms permissions system was updated for admin menu blocking module.

= [4.14.3] 25.07.2014 =
* Integer "1" as default capability value for new added empty role was excluded for the better compatibility with WordPress core. Boolean "true" is used instead as WordPress itself does.
* Integration with Gravity Forms permissions system was enhanced for WordPress multisite.
* Roles import module may import role with integer (not boolean) capability value "1". Error was shown earlier. 
* Error message from import roles module shows role and capability which does not pass the validation rule.

= [4.14.2] 24.07.2014 =
* Admin menu access module: 
    - Bug was fixed which prevented to prohibit direct URL access to the blocked menu items. Recheck roles blocked admin menu items after installing this update as with low probability you may need to redefine them from the scratch. Try to deactivate/activate plugin 1st (Network deactivate/Network Activate for WP multisite). Generally it helps according to the test results;
    - role menu permissions processing was updated for the Gravity Forms plugin under WP multisite.
* Integration with Gravity Forms permissions system was enhanced for WP multisite.
* MySQL query optimized in order to reduce memory consumption.
* Extra WordPress nonce field was removed from the post at main role editor page.
* The instance of main plugin class User_Role_Editor is available for other developers via $GLOBALS['user_role_editor']
* Compatibility issue with the theme ["WD TechGoStore"](http://wpdance.com) is resolved. This theme loads its JS and CSS stuff for admin backend unconditionally - for all pages except loading for its own pages only. 
While the problem is caused just by CSS, URE unloads for optimization purpose all this theme's JS and CSS from WP admin backend pages where conflict is possible.
* Fix for the issue with periodic URE license key value disappearance at WordPress multi-site.
* Minor code enhancements.

= [4.12.1] 01.07.2014 =
* Technical update to fix the issue with the automatic updates API link. This link should start from <code>https://www.role-editor.com</code> instead of <code>https://role-editor.com</code>
This is related to migration of <code>role-editor.com</code> to the Google App Engine platform, which does not support SSL for the naked custom domains and 
force us to use SSL secured links from www subdomain, e.g. <code>https://www.role-editor.com</code> in our case. Starting from this version automatic update is in the working state.
In order to fix the issue for earlier installed version 4.12 You may replace manually the <code>user-role-editor-pro.php</code> file to the file from version 4.12.1 installation package.

= [4.12] 22.04.2014 =
* Use new "Admin Menu" button to block selected admin menu items for role. You need to activate this module at the "Additional Modules". This feature is useful when a lot of submenu items are restricted by the same user capability,
e.g. "Settings" submenu, but you wish allow to user work just with part of it. You may use "Admin Menu" dialog as the reference for your work with roles and capabilities as "Admin Menu" shows 
what user capability restrict access to what admin menu item.
* Posts/Pages edit restriction feature does not prohibit to add new post/page now. Now it should be managed via 'create_posts' or 'create_pages' user capabilities.
* If you use Posts/Pages edit restriction by author IDs, there is no need to add user ID to allow him edit his own posts or page. Current user is added to the allowed authors list automatically.
* New tab "Additional Modules" was added to the User Role Editor options page. As per name all options related to additional modules were moved there.
* Bug was fixed. It had prevented bulk move users without role (--No role for this site--) to the selected role in case such users were shown more than at one WordPress Users page.

= [4.11] 06.04.2014 =

* It is possible to restrict access to the post or page content view for selected roles. Activate the option at plugin "Settings" page and use new "Content View Restrictions" metabox at post/page editor to setup content view access restrictions. <a href="https://role-editor.com/content-view-access-restriction-selected-roles/">Read more...</a>
* Gravity Forms access management module was updated for compatibility with Gravity Forms version 1.8.3. If you need compatibility with earlier Gravity Forms versions, e.g. 1.7.9, use User Role Editor version 4.9.

After use 'switch_to_blog()' in cycle, URE clears '_wp_switched_stack' global variable directly instead of call 'restore_current_blog()' inside the cycle to work faster.

= [4.7] 04.11.2013 =
* "Delete Role" menu has "Delete All Unused Roles" menu item now.
* More detailed warning was added before fulfill "Reset" roles command in order to reduce accident use of this critical operation.

* If license key was installed it is shown as asterisks at the input field.
* In case site domain change you should input license key at the Settings page again.

= [4.6.0.2] 27.10.2013 =
* Bug fix: Invalid notice "Unknown error: Roles import was failed" was shown after successful roles import to the single WordPress site.
* Update: Spaces in user capability are allowed for import to provide compatibility with other plugins, which use spaces in user capabilities, e.g. NextGen Gallery's "NextGEN Change options", etc.

* Bug fix: PHP error prevented to view Gravity Forms entries and WooCommerce coupons after turning on the "Activate user access management to editing selected posts and pages" option.

= [4.6] 23.10.2013 =
* Content editing restriction: It is possible to differentiate permissions for posts/pages creation and editing. Use the "Activate "Create Post/Page" capability" option for that.
* Content editing restriction: Restrict user to edit just selected posts and pages. Use the "Activate user access management to editing selected posts and pages" option for that.
* Multi-site: Assign roles and capabilities to the users from one point at the Network Admin. Add user with his permissions together to all sites of your network with one click.
* Multi-site: unfiltered_html capability marked as deprecated one. Read this post for more information (http://shinephp.com/is-unfiltered_html-capability-deprecated/).

* Bug with multi-site super-admin access to the User Role Editor is fixed. Version 4.5. showed message "Insufficient permissions to work with User Role Editor" until add "manage_network_users" capability to the "Administrator" role. It is enough now to be the "Superadmin" at multi-site network.

= [4.5] 29.08.2013 =
* Direct checking of the "administrator" role is removed from the code to support ability to change User Role Editor access key capability. 
URE uses by default the "administrator" role for single site as the key capability to permit access to the User Role Editor. 
You may change this capability manually by replacing value of URE_KEY_CAPABILITY constant at includes/define_constants.php file. Pro version
starting from 4.5 allows to change this key capability name (input your own, custom one) via User Role Editor settings page.
* The Hebrew translation is added. Thanks to <a href="http://atar4u.com">atar4u</a>.
* Ability to restrict access of different administrators to plugins activation/deactivation on the per plugin base is realized.
Go to the user profile (user should have 'activate_plugins' capability) and select plugins to which you allow access for this user.

In order apply form access restriction to the user it is enough that the user has any capability from the Gravity Forms capabilities list.

= [4.4.1] 16.08.2013 =
* Bug is fixed - user could not edit form fields after forms access restriction activation.

= [4.4] 15.08.2013 =
* Users of "Gravity Forms" plugin may restrict users access to the Forms on per form basis. Activate this option at URE Settings page and input at user's profile the list of Gravity Forms IDs, to which you allow access for this user. User should have at least 'gravityforms_edit_forms' capability in order you see GF access control option at his profile.
* User Role Editor license key is not shown now on the Setting page. User sees just word "Installed" after he saved it.
* Fix: Bug was fixed which prevented creation of current roles backup record during User Role Editor plugin installation and produced unexpected output (PHP notices).

= [4.3] 12.08.2013 =
* "User Role Editor" is available under the "Users" submenu of "Network Admin" for multisite installation. 
It provides the central point for users roles management of the whole network. Your changes are applied to the main site by default.
The click on "Network Update" button replicates roles from the main site to the whole network at once.
* Multisite update: roles from the main (1st) blog are copied to the new added blog automatically, 
even new site is added from front-end after new user registration, e.g. Gravity Forms "Register User" addon does. Earlier this feature worked 
for administrator back-end operations only.
* Bug prevented to apply role changes to all sites of the network is fixed. In case when one of the sites have exactly the same roles as applied from the main site, MySQL returned 0 rows affected. URE recognized that as error and stopped further network updated. It is fixed now.
* Bug prevented to save empty (without capabilities) role is fixed.
* User interface bug with options 'Show capabilities in human readable form' and 'Show deprecated capabilities' fixed. 
Now this checkboxes work this way: It takes global values from the User Role Editor Settings 1st. If you change it at Roles/User editor form plugin, 
it remembers your change temporally for 10 minutes. After that this value will be returned to the URE global settings. 
If you wish to make permanent change make it at URE settings page.

= [4.2] 02.08.2013 =
* Separate setting page is added for User Role Editor under Settings menu. It is available under Network Center "Settings" for the multi-site.
* Option 'show Administrator role in the User Role Editor' was added.
* User with super-admin privilege only may create, edit, delete users by default under multi-site configuration. Use new "Allow create, edit and delete user to not super-administrators" option to workaround this obstacle. Such user still should have correspondent user capabilities as "create_users", "edit_users", "delete_users". 
Thanks to <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/profile/sjobidoo">Sjobidoo</a> for suggested <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-user-role-editor-not-able-to-add-ability-to-edit-users">decision</a>.

= [4.1] 03.07.2013 =
* Quick Filter is added. Type part of any capability. All capabilities containing that word, e.g. 'edit' or 'users' will be highlighted by green color. 
While 'quick filter' is in action 'Select All', 'Unselect All', 'Inverse' buttons work with highlighted capabilities sub-set only. 
Read <a href="https://role-editor.com/user-role-editor-version-4-1-is-available/">this post</a> for more information: 
* Class property and method access modifiers fatal errors were fixed (<a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/fatalerror-1">wordpress.org/support/topic/fatalerror-1</a>).

* New: 'Export/Import' functionality to 'export' all user roles to the local file and 'import' them then to other WordPress blog or other sites of muliti-site WordPress network.
* Added integration with the Gravity Forms plugin. User Role Editor shows Gravity Forms user capabilities at the custom capabilities section.
* Code is fully restructured and encapsulated to PHP classes. Internal global variables are not used anymore.
